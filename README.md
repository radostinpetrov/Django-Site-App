# Django-Site-App
Simple ToDoApp using Django. For reference: https://medium.com/fbdevclagos/how-to-build-a-todo-app-with-django-17afdc4a8f8c
 
The app let's you choose a category name and a descrition for your item and add it to the list. The user can add and remove tasks.

Extended the app with additional weather forecast support. Using the openweathermap.org/current API the app displays a card with
the city and the weather and a simple description.
The goal idea is to have the app display weather at the date that the task card is due.
